Chucking Detection using PoseNet in ml5.js

## Problem Statement 
To check if a bowler is chucking, in real time. 


## Overview 
In the sport of cricket, throwing, commonly referred to as chucking, is an illegal bowling action which occurs when a bowler straightens the bowling arm when delivering the ball. The Laws of Cricket specify that only the rotation of the shoulder can be used to impart velocity to the ball â€“ a bowler's arm must not extend during the bowling action. If the umpire deems that the ball has been thrown, they will call a no-ball which means the batsman cannot be given out from that delivery.

A set of tiered tolerance thresholds for the amount of allowable elbow extension, or straightening, were implemented: **10 degrees for fast bowlers**, **7.5 degrees for medium pacers**, and **5 degrees for spin bowlers**. Enforcing these new measures proved problematic, as the laboratory based measurement systems used had a margin of error of at least 1 degree, and video based measurement systems were likely to have more, especially if inappropriately executed.
